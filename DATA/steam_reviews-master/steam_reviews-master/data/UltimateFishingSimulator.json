The menu is drastically unoptimized (huge frame drop). BUT, I've not had it crash yet, even with the latest released features. You do need to have a fairly strong gaming system to play it.\n\nIce fishing, lakes, rivers, boats, fly fishing, whatever your little heart desires, and if it's not here, the dev is probably planning on adding it.

At it's current stage it'd be pushing to say it's worth $5. Graphics and animations are at the stage of a 2005 game. Fish fighting mechanics are very basic and forgiving, they don't put any burst of speed on, get a 2nd wind or jump. I figured it would be overpriced and still decided to give it a shot since it didn't seem to have all those addons that modern fishing games seem to milk money from. Fortunately it has none of that, but I don't see it being worth it's current price for at least another 2 years. The fact that fish will swim from 10m off straight to the bait in the exact same animation and eat it immediately, removes any sort of excitement or joy from the game. Fish will never show interest in your bait they'll only swim straight up and eat it in the exact same manner every time, they'll also only ever start eating after a set period of time has past. Rod control is non-existent apart from the lift rod button. Imparting the slightest lure action that is currently possible is apparently coded to stop the fish biting the lure. The only recognised luring technique is straight reeling it in. As far as I can tell there is no greater chance of the fish taking your lure than it is some bait. So since you can keep your bait near the fish much more easily than a lure it's pretty much 10x more effective just to stick to bait. I haven't noticed any difference in feeding patterns. There are 10+ year old fishing games that are better than this.","timestamp_created":1533814567,"timestamp_updated":1533814567,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499347","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true},{"recommendationid":"44447182","author":{"steamid":"76561198016532681","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":148,"last_played":1535813489},"language":"english","review":"This is by far the best fishing game out there.
