However, this isnt the gripe, i dont have a problem with obtaining enough points, and being skilled enough to unlock levels. HOWEVER it is a bit of a problem, when the threshhold for unlocking levels is very high and you have to sorta grind, by playing levels over again to get 2 or 3 stars to be able to play 1 level. This wasnt a particular problem until mid-late game however, but the game does expect you to get 2 or 3 stars out of every level if you wanna play all the levels and beat the game.\n\n\nThat however is my only annoyance, a high star requirement (possible 3 stars for every level). Just playing some levels over and over to get an absurd amount of points to unlock a single extra star to play the next level and then do that sorta thing again, can be annoying, but fortunately not boring. Replaying levels again isnt so bad when you have to try harder and you get better at the game, sometimes its easier, but again, i feel i shouldnt have to get perfect ratings on so many levels.\n\nThat point aside, this is a great game, lots of fun and it has amazing local co op gameplay, you can even share a keyboard and one controller (one controller, 2 people, its nuts i know) between 2 people, me and my girlfriend have been playing on her laptop keyboard and its a little cramped, but not toO bad at all or hindering our  experience.\n\nI paid $5 for everything, but i say full price is worth it too.\n\nGreat game.","timestamp_created":1534680795,"timestamp_updated":1534682484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.000000","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44213177","author":{"steamid":"76561198143123878","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":277,"last_played":1535014312},"language":"english","review":"controlling two characters is so hard.
