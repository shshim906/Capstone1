Well then get this game!  Have trouble getting into a window right above you?  This is the game for you!  Do you enjoy play control that delays nearly everything you do so you have to repeat hit buttons like in the ole days?  Welcome back to the 1990's.  Want to be forced to climb slower than previous games and be forced to run slow?  This is it!  Want to see bad physics and models that stutter even after years of this game being released?  Try it!  Want to have a story so boring and unintersted you long for Ezio and the 2nd through 4th games?  This may be your jam!  Want to have mostly all the side quests be tedious and boring?  Yep we got that too.  Honestly after putting in a few hours to this game it is undoubetdly the worst in the series BY FAR.  And the graphics are not that great yet my PC is whirring just to generate them.  I got this on a Steam Sale I thik for $5 or $10.  I would NEVER pay over $30 for this game.   I want to beat it just to see the resolve of it but man is it bad.  Last game I played of the series was IV.  So it was like going from solid gold to solid crap.\n\nUpdate 8\/23:  Finally beat the game and man does it suck.  How can you have a lineage like this and as a dev team make a game this bad?  I mean nothing about the game is redeeming.  Finishing this game felt like eating brocolli to get rewarded with lettuce.  The ending is not even that good.  I kind of wonder if you even need to play it to have continuity with the other games.  Anyways if you have never played Assassins Creed and want a good game play IV, II or I hear Origins is good as well.  This game should be up there with ET in the anals of video game failures.","timestamp_created":1534431424,"timestamp_updated":1535038079,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521739","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44413877","author":{"steamid":"76561198212751615","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1512050179},"language":"english","review":"History is good, graphics are good, main character is good.

This is a good thing, because it keeps you from remembering how utterly hateable and borderline  stupid you main-character is! You give no f*** whatsoever about him, and you know how AC sometimes misinterprets your commands and you jump of a high tower to you death by accident? Now you will cheer on as he ends his inane existence again and again and again. \n\nEvery good bit about this game vaporizes because it is as if the devs actually went like: \"Wow! You know this cool mechanic that our intern worked at for a week? It turned out pretty cool! Lets make the player repeat it all the fucking time and set all our setpieces around this one cool mechanic we got now!\"\n\nGREAT IDEA!\n\nThe worst AC by far. I liked AC:BF and i really dig Origins right now, but this game here really makes you feel like your ancestors give you chores collectivly from their graves.","timestamp_created":1535316695,"timestamp_updated":1535316695,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500000","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44053755","author":{"steamid":"76561198046773415","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1533937791},"language":"english","review":"Nope","timestamp_created":1533937879,"timestamp_updated":1533937879,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]}
