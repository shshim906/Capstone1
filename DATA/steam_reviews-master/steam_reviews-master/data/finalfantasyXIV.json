I leveled every job to 60+, several to 70. After playing for several months you start to realize how anti-social this game is. They did a great job making things more accessible for new players to end game but in doing so they indirectly discourage socialization, I've been in 5 different free companies (guilds) and even with 50+ memebers online at once hardly anyone talks. Joining random groups for dungeons, which is what you will do 99% of the time, feels like you're playing alone. On rare occasions you will get a group that chatts but generally people won't even respond when you say hi or they respond with 0\/ which I guess means hi but then they won't say anything else.\n\nThe game itself is great but I would only recommend this game if you have a group of rl friends to play with.\n\nI rated it down because MMOs are about socialization and this game barely feels like an mmo for 90% of the time playing. I would give it a thumbs up if it was a single player or multiplayer but not advertised as an mmo, as it is a great game in itself.","timestamp_created":1533569237,"timestamp_updated":1533569237,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.607192","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44280264","author":{"steamid":"76561198019050324","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":102835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1530308521},"language":"english","review":"Ok, so it's $15 monthly to play this game.\n\nWhat are you paying for, exactly?\n\nEvery four months there's a content patch.  It's done in such a way that every 8 months you get (as of right now)\n-A new raid tier (complete with 4 savage fights and 4 normal fights)\n-A 24 man raid tier (more casual focused, an actual raid dungeon)\n-3 dungeons (casual content, or content that can be farmed hardcore for endgame currency)\n-Side progression updates (currently, Eureka)\n-Side quests in the form of Hildebrand, etc.\n-New crafting tiers and gatheirng tiers to keep the market fresh and to keep crafting relevant to endgame progression (even if it's just first week for most things, crafted gear is great for alts, and potions and food will always be relevant)\n-PvP updates\n-Ongoing Story updates.\n\nYou're paying $15 monthly for a living breathing game that free to play games like Guild Wars 2 can't really compete with no matter how well they advertise themselves.\n\nSo how is it?\n\nIt's a typical tab target, GCD MMO.  Except it's done really well.  What is most often criticized about the game is it's 2.5 second GCD, which is slow compared to the 1.5 second GCD everyone is used to.  But what this allows for is the game to expand on many other aspects of the tab target combat that other MMO's really can't.  Off globals are way more impactful, and using them properly or planning their use so that they don't interfere with your rotation makes combat way more engaging in my opinion than in an MMO like World of Warcraft and Star Wars: The Old Republic (assuming the latter can even be considered relevant).  If you still consider combat to be extremely slow, I recommend you try bard or ninja in the free trial to see whether or not this game is right for you, since before 35 they get more OGCDs than the other classes.  If even with mudras you think the game is too slow, then perhaps this game's combat is not for you.\n\nWhat about the endgame?  What about the actual content?\n\nIf you're an endgame player, this is the MMO for you.  Get to endgame, enjoy the raiding content that this game has to offer, and maybe even challenge ultimate content, content that will always be relevant no matter how high the level cap gets.\n\nIf you're not an endgame player, you can still enjoy the theme park MMO for what it is.  If you adore the Final Fantasy aesthetic, there's no end to the amount of stuff there is to do, and moreso if you can find friends to explore this game with.  This game wastes no time to reference all the other Final Fantasies in the form of fights, raids, trials, dungeons, gear, events, and so on.\n\nFor both, you can enjoy all classes and playstyles in this game on a single character due to the job system.  You level up a paladin to 70 but now you want to try out Warrior, so you start out with your Warrior level 1 and so on and so forth until you have as many classes you like to play at 70.  Hardcore raiders may have all of their healers at 70 so they can pick and choose, for instance.  Casual players can just enjoy the many playstyles that the game has to offer.\n\nHowever:  The game is admittedly experiencing a bit of content drought.  The devs are getting complacent and releasing less and less (money goes into FFXIV, out into every project Square Enix wants to fund).  A lot of the players are hoping that SE has a bit of a wakeup call before they lose their sub base and are forced to make unpopular decisions.\n\nSince you're reading this review, you're probably wondering whether or not now is the time to get into the game?  Casually, and for the hardcore player, definitely yes.  And if you're hardcore, maybe you may find it worthwhile to level all the other classes so you can prepare to compete.  If you're casual, there's really no end to the content that exists in this game, and the content drought really doesn't affect you.  Every hour you spend in this game is very much worth your sub.  And even if you run out of things to do, you can always just wait until content does come out.\n\nAt the very least, give the free trial a try.  I've played this game for almost 5 years now, without stopping my sub, and this game has been worth every penny.","timestamp_created":1534792727,"timestamp_updated":1534792727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523810","comment_count":"1","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43951126","author":{"steamid":"76561198132332983","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":74110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7146,"last_played":1535835149},"language":"english","review":"I finally finished making my char :D cant wait to see wat the game is like :o","timestamp_created":1533490927,"timestamp_updated":1533490927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":59,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582087","comment_count":"8","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44259440","author":{"steamid":"76561197987822184","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":71163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5394,"last_played":1535851790},"language":"english","review":"\n--{Graphics}---\nX You forget what reality is\nO Beautiful\nO Good\nO Decent\nO Bad\nO Don\u2018t look too long at it\nO Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\nO Addictive like heroin\nO Very good\nX Good\nO It\u2018s just gameplay\nO Mehh\nO Starring at walls is better\nO Just don\u2018t\n\n---{Audio}---\nX Eargasm\nO Very good\nO Good\nO Not too bad\nO Bad\nO Earrape\n\n---{Audience}---\nO Kids\nX Teens\nX Adults\nO Average Solitare Players\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\nO Check if you can run paint\nO Potato\nX Decent\nO Fast\nO Rich boiiiiii\nO Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\nO Just press \u201aA\u2018\nO Easy\nO Significant brain usage\nX Easy to learn \/ Hard to master\nO Difficult\nO Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\nO Nothing to grind\nO Only if u care about leaderboards\/ranks\nO Isnt necessary to progress\nX Average grind level\nO Too much grind\nO You\u2018ll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\nO If you want story, then go read a book.\nO Text or Audio floating around\nO Average depends an DLC\nO Good\nO Lovley\nX It\u2018ll replace your life \n\n---{Game Time}---\nO Long enough for a cup of tea\nO Short\nO Average\nO Long\nX To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\nO There is no \u201eprice\u201c\nX Worth the price\nO If u have some spare money left\nO Not recommended\nO You could also just burn your money \n\n---{Bugs}---\nO Never heard of\nX Minor bugs\nO Can get annoying\nO Assassin\u2018s Creed: Unity\nO Get a bug spray.
