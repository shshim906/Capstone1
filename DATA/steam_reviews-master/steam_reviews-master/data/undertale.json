It has it's pros and cons like any game would, but I feel the pros out-weight the cons. My main ones are as follows:\n\nPROS\n- The game, especially when compared to others I've played, runs very smoothly and have little to no bugs that I can think of.\n- The game is deeply story rich. If you have the right mind for it, you can really get drawn into the game from that.\n- As I'm sure anyone who's ever heard of the game can say, the audio is wonderful. The soundtracks are beautiful and fit the settings wonderfully.\n- While being single-player, I'd never call it a game where you'd get \"lonely.\" Some single-player games feel like they drag a bit because there is no one else there, but this one doesn't.\n- You get to choose your path. With the different routes available, you can go completely different ways and still end yourself with a wonderful ending.\n- The game is easy enough (in pacifist and neutral) to get through within a reasonable amount of time, but it still doesn't feel rushed.\n- Being able to name your character is fun if you ask me.\n- As far as pixel graphic games go, I'd definitely say this has one of the better graphics.\n- The character are all independent, but yet work together well. They have different personalities that are kept constant throughout the gameplay.\n- The controls aren't bad.\n- It's not overly expensive.\n- Good for nearly all ages.\n\nCONS\n- The genocide route has a lot of mandatory grinding, which can be tedious.\n- (not for me personally but) If you don't like pixel graphics, then that's a con.\n- I feel like you can only play it a number of times before getting bored (though that's the same with many other games and I was able to play this for hours without reaching that point).\n- The fanbase can get a bit... weird and annoying (but that's just my opinion after going out of the fanbase, so take it with a grain of salt).\n\nOf course, this doesn't cover everything, but it hits all the main things I could think of right off the bat. I definitely do recommend this game and I think it's worth the price.","timestamp_created":1534696408,"timestamp_updated":1534696408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.773546","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44190784","author":{"steamid":"76561198309594175","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1534516546},"language":"koreana","review":"\ud558.....\uac4d \ub2e5\uce58\uace0 \uc0ac\uc11c \ud558\ubd10\ub77c","timestamp_created":1534435644,"timestamp_updated":1534435644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471299","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44274367","author":{"steamid":"76561198358497448","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1519032442},"language":"koreana","review":"PPAP","timestamp_created":1534772385,"timestamp_updated":1534772385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494901","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44067682","author":{"steamid":"76561197960282975","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1534259730},"language":"english","review":"First few minutes were questionable, but if you give it a chance, it's without a doubt something you can easily fall in love with.","timestamp_created":1533991422,"timestamp_updated":1533991422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.728619","comment_count":"2","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43923375","author":{"steamid":"76561198311268066","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1520929754},"language":"koreana","review":"\uc544! \uc5b8\ub354\ud14c\uc77c \uc544\uc2dc\ub294\uad6c\ub098!","timestamp_created":1533368534,"timestamp_updated":1533368534,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485981","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44028155","author":{"steamid":"76561198320407534","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1533849139},"language":"english","review":"just frickin play it\n","timestamp_created":1533849191,"timestamp_updated":1533849191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":26,"weighted_vote_score":"0.699362","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44022118","author":{"steamid":"76561198306893439","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1533919967},"language":"english","review":"I love this game.

It's one of my favourite games of the last few years. But I have to get some things off my chest.\n\nTo start with, it looks pretty mediocre. I know it's not particularly important for a game like this, but it's worth mentioning. The main cast is very well designed but a lot of the NPCs look like they were slapped together in Paint in a hurry. There are only two graphics modes: a tiny window, which can't be resized, and full-screen, which retains the 640x480 resolution and does not scale up well. The user interface is extremely basic and could stand to be a lot better.\n\nMovement is slow and boring. Often I wanted to explore more of the game-world but just didn't have the patience for it, even with the river ferry providing shortcuts to a couple of places. Too many areas are just overly long, empty corridors, especially when backtracking.\n\nThe bullet time mechanic is very hit-and-miss, no pun intended. Some fights feel fair and entertaining, others unfair or tedious. It doesn't help that the game is capped at 30 FPS and seems to have a fair amount of input lag. Then again, I'm probably just a bit rubbish at it.\n\nHere's the big one for me: the neutral ending is awful. When I got there for the first time, it felt like a giant slap in the face, like all the time I'd spent on my playthrough was for nothing. I won't spoil it, but the final boss is by far the worst fight in the game and probably my least favourite encounter in [I]any[\/I] video game I've ever played. And the reward you get for beating it is pathetic. \"But it's not the true ending!\" people say. I know, but that doesn't change the fact that it is the first ending every player will see, nor the fact that if you go into the game with no prior knowledge of the different \"routes\" available to you, as I did, it is the [I]only[\/I] ending you will see without starting over. That's poor design.\n\nSpeaking of starting over, the game only lets you keep one save, and forces you to overwrite it as you progress through the game, so there's no way of going back to fix a past mistake, if you notice you've made one. Additionally, once you've started the neutral ending sequence, there's nothing you can do but keep playing - you can't even access the main menu to reset your save. You can work around both of these issues by manually copying and pasting save files in the game folder, but that shouldn't be necessary. I know it is supposed to tie into the lore, but it's my belief that immersion should never come at the expense of accessibility.\n\nNow, onto the things I liked. I have to start with the soundtrack, which is phenomenal. Toby Fox really knocked it out of the park here. From intense songs like Megalovania and Hopes and Dreams, to uplifting songs like Ruins and CORE, to silly songs like Ghost Fight and Bonetrousle, it's all great, and there are very few game soundtracks I could say that about. I often find myself thinking about, and then listening to, the Undertale OST even when I haven't played the game in a long time.\n\nThe cast is very memorable too. Toriel is, obviously, wonderful. Asgore has some sympathetic moments too. Sans and Papyrus made me laugh out loud many times, and stood out even in a game full of humour. Undyne is just cool - sorry, Papyrus. Alphys, while irritating at first, ends up having the most interesting story of them all. I wish Flowey didn't exist, but all the other NPCs and enemies, particularly the dogs, add a lot to the game. And while the \"power of friendship\" narrative has been done to death already, it still works here. I felt quite moved on a few occasions, and sometimes it felt like the game was talking specifically to me as a person rather than the character I was controlling.\n\nSteam's \"Choices Matter\" tag is very apt for Undertale, and while I complained above that many new players will not grasp it first time around, it's largely a good thing. The game is so deep that if you count all the different phone call dialogues, there are over 90 endings. It adapts to what kind of playthrough you are attempting - characters react to you differently, some battles get harder, others are skipped, and so on. There's a strong meta element to it all, which will really get you thinking about your choices, past and present. Personally, I find it refreshing to play a game where killing isn't necessary. How you play is entirely up to you; just be prepared to do some research to see all the different possibilities.\n\nThankfully, the good outweighs the bad, and Undertale has left a lasting positive impression on me. It might not the best game ever, but it's a game worth experiencing for yourself. Recommended.","timestamp_created":1535059911,"timestamp_updated":1535644105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617647","comment_count":"3","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44431175","author":{"steamid":"76561198301543366","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":37,"last_played":1535578633},"language":"english","review":"its a game","timestamp_created":1535486209,"timestamp_updated":1535486209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611231","comment_count":"1","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44227231","author":{"steamid":"76561198403214406","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1533783666},"language":"koreana","review":"\ucd08\ub529\uac9c","timestamp_created":1534590719,"timestamp_updated":1534590719,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.382803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]}
