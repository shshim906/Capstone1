I made an exception for this game though, and it was worth it. The story (even if it left me with a lot of unanswered questions) is one of the strongest features of this game, and the other is the atmosphere. The game is pretty good, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that it could\u2019ve been even better. Some aspects were lacking polish \u2013 for example some of the enemies were looking goofy (especially their movement), instead of being terrifying. The 3D models of the people were badly done. A lot of the environments felt too linear and I feel like more effort should\u2019ve been put into the design of the open water scenes near the end. I want to comment on the run-and hide tactics that the studio likes to put in their games. I\u2019m pretty sure this game could\u2019ve benefited immensely with a more traditional approach, if it included some weapons and more action scenes to fight the enemies. A quick save and quick load would\u2019ve been useful too, because I felt I didn\u2019t find a lot of the background little tidbits of information. Even with all the flaws the game is a pretty refreshing experience, so I recommend it to anyone who likes the sci-fi genre.","timestamp_created":1534791219,"timestamp_updated":1534791219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554716","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43976372","author":{"steamid":"76561197969489829","num_games_owned":581,"num_reviews":146,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1533588899},"language":"english","review":"SOMA is a 2015 horror game developed by Frictional games and played by me. But is it any good?\n\nI'd tell you if you would stop hitting me. \n\nYou play as Simon, a man with a brain boo boo. Simon, living in Toronto, visits a man named David Munshi who is offering to do an experimental brain scan on Simon so that they could find a cure for the symptoms of slowly dying. But after his brain scan, Simon is suddenly transported to some kind of facility that seems to be abandoned.\nBut Simon soon finds out that the facility is inhabited by strange creatures, an ever expanding artificial intelligence, and also he was transported to a hundred years in the future.\nAll in all its an improvement over Toronto. \n\nLike frictional's last few horror games, SOMA is a first person puzzle adventure where you try reach the end without getting smooshed by a hyper aggressive chicken robot. Its kind of hard to talk about, since there really isn't much to it outside of exploring, hiding, and puzzle solving, so I'm basically just going to talk about the game as a whole. \n\nPathos-II, the place you hang out in for the entire game, is pretty cool to explore. Considering its underwater after the end of the world you get feeling or sense of dread you wouldn't get from a haunted house or castle or whatever.\n\npart the time, your only company is the sound of your own foot steps and Simon's breathing. The other time you're surrounded by the sounds of engines, moving parts, and distance echoes. And sometimes its just the sounds of water and the muffled going ons in said water. \nMusic is used very sparingly, which is nice, since it lets you get lost in the atmosphere of Pathos-II, which is so thick you could cut it with a knife or post about how you're attracted to it on internet forums. \n\nAlso, I heard a whale a few times. I never saw the whale.\nI made me sad. \n\nI wouldn't really say the game was scary, but it was very upsetting. The themes the game explores and the questions the game asks isn't really something tackled all that often in any medium, let alone video games. It can be interesting just kind of uncovering the lives of the people who lived down here and what happened to them.\n\nWhat I always found odd is just how calm and casual people on Pathos-II were, considering all of the dialogue you get from them comes from after the apocalypse. You can get info from dead bodies and communication thinger-majiggers on the wall that give you a play back from characters you [spoiler]usually[\/spoiler] never meet.\nI guess after the world ends and the shock wears off you just kind of deal with it. \n\nWhats cool is that it isn't usually one of those \u201cHere's some dialogue oops now they're dead\u201d kinds of games, though it does happen. A lot of characters constantly reappear in the playbacks, and you even get familiar with some of them. Maybe they could even still be alive? It gives you at least a little bit of hope in a hopeless situation. \n\nThe game is at it's strongest when its being slow and somber. Being able to explore the areas you uncover and finding clues and evidence of people's fates was probably my favorite part of the game. Just being alone in Pathos-II was unsettling enough as it is. Though you end up with a pocket buddy really early on, you can only talk to them when they're plugged in to something, so you get the best of both worlds what with the crushing isolation followed by yelling at your Ipad. \n\nEvery now and then you'll have to deal with a spooky monster. Now, I don't mind dealing with monsters, I especially like that most areas had a unique enemy to deal with. Ranging from chicken robots to the world's first human technolight, to a guy called Jin. They all have a different way to be dealt with, but you won't be boxing any of them anytime soon. \n\nThe problem I had with them is, they're just kind of annoying? They feel like they're in there mostly out of necessity, because Frictional is known for being the spooky monster guys. I know they have a in-lore reason as to why they're trying to eat my booty, or punch the hell out of me. But at the same time they're so easy to deal with its practically not worth it. \n\nI didn't even really have an encounter with the robot chicken. The first time he just kind of walked off to the left and the second time he just kind of... Walked off to the left. In fact, two of the last monsters you encounter I didn't even know were hunting me until I was almost out of their area. And two other encounters I just kind of let them beat me up because I knew I would get up a few seconds later and they would be out of my way. \nLike the second monster who just kind of teleported in place and wouldn't let me go where I needed to go until I just ran into him and he head butted me into submission before leaving.\n\nI played the game on normal mode because I'm a big boy, but if I ever play again I'm probably going to just switch it to safe mode or track down that mod that removes the monsters all together, just so I can dink around the area and then leave on my own pace instead of having to go because the ghost of Captain Cutler wants to mug me for the quarters in my pocket. \n\nIts still good, if not just for the atmosphere alone. I haven't really played all that much Amnesia, but I think I'll go back and take a look at it. Get the game on sale, its not really a full-price game, but its worth it on a discount.\nThe game will only take you a few hours, even less than me if you stop getting up to do something else mid play through. It says I played for ten hours, but I honestly only played around seven or eight. \n\nI'm also apparently a minority, since most people apparently never got past the third chapter, let alone beat the game.\nIts not that scary, come on.\n\nI feel like getting gobbled up by the Lets Play crowed was kind of bad for this game, considering it isn't really one of those big screamy kind of games. Its a much slower, more somber, and actually pretty upsetting game over a spooky jump scare game. \nThere's also a workshop with some really talented creators, with a lot of the stories and levels having their own lore and story. If you really like how SOMA plays, then you can keep going for awhile longer after the original game. \n\nAs a story game, its pretty good, but as a jump scare simulator? Not so much. But thats not a bad thing, who pays 20 dollars to get screamed at by strangers? \n\nSOMA gets a sad robot out of a angry robot. \n\nThe pancreas produces insulin. \n\n[url=https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/curator\/7124597\/]You'll join the curator if you know whats good for you.

I abandoned it for a few years and have finally come back to it. I don't remember what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. For one thing it shouldn't be labelled horror. It's a walking simulator with the occasional horror elements. I'm not a big fan of the horror parts they do include. It's mainly strange monsters that you can't defend against, so you have to hide in the dark and hope they don't notice you (but chances are they will if they get anywhere near you). The first once or twice you get caught it's a huge jumpscare, but it gets old quickly. The game has no HUD, pause screen where you can check your objectives, etc. It's all about immersion. You know what breaks immersion pretty quickly? Constantly dying whenever there are monsters nearby. Thankfully there are only a few sections where you have to deal with them.\n\nIf it sounds like I hate the game I don't. But it definitely has it's flaws. The lack of knowing what your objective is means that if you put it down for any length of time and come back, you'll have no idea what you're supposed to be doing. Another issue I had was some of the outside parts made it really easy to get lost. Once I started using a walkthrough it got way better. I didn't use it constantly, but I did have to rely on it pretty heavily which was unfortunate. I needed it both to not get lost and to find the best way to get around the annoying enemies.\n\nThe exploration and finding various logs to figure out what happened was quite enjoyable. The story is really strange, but that's not a bad thing. I also think they ended it very well. If the issues above were addressed and it was advertised more accurately this could be a really enjoyable game.","timestamp_created":1534263672,"timestamp_updated":1534263672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560000","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44354240","author":{"steamid":"76561198112684640","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":352,"last_played":1535130968},"language":"english","review":"It wasn't just good, it was amazing.

That said the game has a \"safe\" mode that keeps them from killing you (and keeps them from basically wasting your time on a do-over).  Safe mode also gives you the chance to look at things and experience parts of the story that are easy to miss if are constantly running from mosters. I found safe mode to be considerably more enjoyable.\n\nLinear story. There are a few occasions when you can make choices but they seem to be entirely inconsequential, at least in my chain of events. Maybe one day I'll feel like trying a different path, but I get the feeling it will not change anything.\n\nThere are lots of things to touch in the environment but the majority of them are just inanimate objects that are completely useless.

Well, you already know what will happen in that \"fateful\" day.","timestamp_created":1533781766,"timestamp_updated":1533828801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501845","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44056080","author":{"steamid":"76561198056526739","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1534515914},"language":"english","review":"Best Game Ever!!!","timestamp_created":1533947563,"timestamp_updated":1533947563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.000000","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44059697","author":{"steamid":"76561198273515059","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1534533674},"language":"english","review":"It's 1 in the morning and I have the lights off.
