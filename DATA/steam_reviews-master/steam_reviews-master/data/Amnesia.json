Was it fear keeping me back from playing this game, so (in)famous for it's hilarious Let's Play high-squeeling-in-fear fests? Maybe. A little bit. Mostly.\n\nAnyways, Amnesia is everything they say about it on the internet (yes, even \"that\") and I had a delightful scare throughout my first 3 hours of gameplay (died once already #noshame). Now, I must admit I ignored the advice of the game to play it in a completely dark room, mostly because it is a gazillion degrees inside and I don't have any way to make it completely dark in my living room at 3 pm. Did that make it any less scary? No. It didn't. Not. at. all. I played it for exactly 83 minutes (Steam told me so) before I had to go drink some fresh orange juice and watch some my little pony. \n\nSome of the scares were made extra scary by the ventilator buzzing away and randomly catching on some invisible defect until I nearly threw it across the room after a very inconvenient hiccup during the water scene. Other times my smartphone vibrated to inform me of a text message when [spoiler]the shadow suddenly appeared behind an open door[\/spoiler] and I managed to soil my pants only a little bit.\n\nSo yes, this game delivers. And I will be playing it a lot more. When it's less warm. Because of the creepy ventilator. Not because I'm a chicken. \n\n","timestamp_created":1533576642,"timestamp_updated":1533576642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561833","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44233190","author":{"steamid":"76561198122761963","num_games_owned":601,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1509906634},"language":"english","review":"Mr. Chair and stophano are the best!!!","timestamp_created":1534608949,"timestamp_updated":1534608949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44154978","author":{"steamid":"76561198007035381","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1501544799},"language":"english","review":"Terrifying, disturbing and slightly depressing.","timestamp_created":1534296139,"timestamp_updated":1534296139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44135820","author":{"steamid":"76561197970669257","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":2132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1367650800},"language":"english","review":"The game is starting to show its age graphically and I'm used to its scares by now, but when I first played it in 2010 my butt puckered so hard you could have made diamonds in there.
