STEAM store has over 77,000 applications(this includes games, expansion packs, and ost packs etc) and a game company can often have a hard time standing out in those cluster without spending a good amount of money in marketing. This may not always be so easy especially if the company is small or the game they have appeals to a smaller number of people.
Recommender system is a great way for a product to get a little more boost in this regard, as it tries to appeal to the very players that are likely to find the game interesting. By analyzing the customer and the game to suggest games that the customers are more likely to be attracted to, we can increase the sale of the product and save a little more money on marketing.
